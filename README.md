## LynkMe
LynkMe is a way to persist online articles and share them with friend groups. The idea came from realizing how many articles my friends and parents sent me via email or text - scrolling through messages to refer back to them wasn't ideal. 

Enter LynkMe - the app authenticates users through Facebook and allows them to create friend groups based on Facebook friends who also use the app.
